## How to Test

<details>
    <summary>Test the Login Page</summary>

    -- As a user, I want to log in to the application, so I can access the home page --
    
    The user can log in with the following credentials:

    username: "mor_2314",
    password: "83r5^_‚Äù
    
    After the login, the user will be redirected to the home page.

    Tests:

    Informing the wrong credentials, the user will see an error message.

    When you run the project, you will see the login page, testing forcing the '/' route will be redirected to the login page, and the user will be able to access the home page ONLY after the successful login.

    Note: After the successful login, a token will be stored in the local storage, and the user will be redirected to the home page, causing the forcing of '/login' route to redirect to the home page.
